# Sensor Record

Sensor recording app for Android

The app has only been tested on a Nexus 5x. It should run on most Android devices running Marshmallow or higher (6.0+).

The current version should be considered pre-release software, and uploaded in this early state primarily for NOWCAM 2017.

Everything is functional, however, I'm in the process of 1) adding new features and 2) removing code/functionality specific to my use in the lab, with the goal of making the app more generally applicable.

I've also written a Python package called `sensormotion`, which can be found [here](https://github.com/sho-87/sensormotion). It contains various functions to help with peak detection and calculation of gait parameters from accelerometry.
